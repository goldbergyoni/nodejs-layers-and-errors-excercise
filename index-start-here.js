// 👿 Few words from your product manager:
// The travelling recommender app works great for our customers
// However we face many stability and maintenance issues
// Make it a robust application!

// 🧚‍ Few words from your architect:
//1. Use the travelling recommender code, see 'travelling-recommender-service.js
//2. Wrap it with Get route
//3. Partition the code into layers (folders), maybe organize it better
//4. Create your custom Error object, handle errors properly
//5. Ensure that given insufficient input - 400 error is returned
//6. Ensure that when unknown error is thrown, the error is handled 
//and the process stays alive (see 'travelling-recommender-service.js constructor)
//7. Log all requests using a middleware

// 💰 Bonus: 
//1. Prevent DDOS by using a rate limiter middleware:
//https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit
//2. Allow invoking the code using terminal 'node recommend.js Bangkok 01/01/2020'
//Use process.argv to read the arguments
